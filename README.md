I use this project to test anything I might find interesting as a developer. It is a
[universal javascript](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) application
based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). A quick rundown of the most interesting parts:

### structure

The application's organization is by function, not by type, as I've found that to be a much more
maintainable structure in the long run. I've based the approach mainly on these two articles:

* [Three Rules For Structuring (Redux) Applications](https://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/) by Jack Hsu
* [How to better organize your React applications?](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1) by Alexis Mangin

They're definitely worth your time if you're looking for an efficient way to organize a React
codebase.

### browser support

As a frontend developer you'll always have to keep browser support in mind when writing code. I've
automated checking browser support for my code as much as possible:

* [eslint-plugin-compat](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat) checks the browser
compatibility for my javascript
* [stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features](https://github.com/ismay/stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features)
does the same for my css
* [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) compiles only what needs to be
compiled, meaning I'm always shipping javascript that's as modern as possible

The browsers that I want to support are defined in the [browserslist](browserslist). Browserslist
documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ai/browserslist).

### deployment

I run this project on a [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) server with this [Cloud-Config](https://gist.github.com/ismay/da7acd94f07666a5308c4946f4482acb)
on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). It is comprised of three dockers, where one is
built from the code in this repository (so an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server serving the
React application), and the other two are:

* An [Nginx reverse proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)
* A [Let's Encrypt service](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) that
takes care of generating and automatically renewing my ssl certificates through [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

The docker container for this project is built by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and can be found
on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ismay/ismaywolff.nl/).
